            Hi everyone! My name is Chloe, and I am a sophmore at RPI this year.
            Originaly, I had planned to major in Computer Science here at RPI, but I 
            after taking intro to IT and Web Science my freshman year, I decidded to change 
            my major. I am also a member of the swim team here at RPI- I specialize in 
            swimming Breaststroke. I am looking forward to learning so much more about web 
            development this year, and I am thrilled to have a year at RPI that feels so close 
            to normal!
        </p>
