README File for Lab 1-

For this lab, we created a general homepage a resume, and about pages for each of the
members of our group. I (chloe) worked on creating the home/index page for our group.
We worked with some of thie very similar material last year in intro to IT, so some of it,
such as the resume was not super time consuming, after cleaning it up and updating it. When I
work with HTML and CSS I always have some formatting problems, and this time I just could not get
the top right hand corner- where all of our about pages are listed- to space out a little more.
Sometimes it feels like no matter how much I reseach it, the CSS doesn't want to work with me. I tried to add in 
an accordian to sort some of the info on our webpage, so it didnt get too busy. In the accordion are our
resumes and our projects/accomplishments. This assignment was relatively very time consuming, just because it is
hard to get HTML and CSS to format the way that I had envisioned it, but a lot of it was familiar, because 
I had used it in Intro to IT last year.
